# Gaolin (Hans) Zhang

Hey, I'm a second-year master student from North Carolina State University, majoring in Computer Science. I am going to join [eBay](https://tech.ebayinc.com/) this summer as a software engineer. You can also know more about my past experience from my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ih_Bo6aA-NO6LPjQBv-M4tKsxBYrtifY/view?usp=sharing).
